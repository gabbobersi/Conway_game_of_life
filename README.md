## Background
I was searching for a project with fast implementation, quick visual feedback and a lot of room for improvement.
All this, with the addition of a lot of fun. Here's the idea.

Here some resources I used:
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
- [YouTube Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Plq-D1gEk&ab_channel=Numberphile)
